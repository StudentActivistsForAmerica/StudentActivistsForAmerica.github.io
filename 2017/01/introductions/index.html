      <p>Hi everyone! We are SAFA, a political activism organization for Bay Area students. We focus on real issues that are present in today&rsquo;s America, such as women&rsquo;s health, racial discrimination, health care, poverty, the environment, and many more. We then take these issues and work to fix them, by holding fundraisers and donation drives, volunteering, protesting, and spreading awareness, usually working on one issue per month. The difference between our mission and that of other activism organizations is that we intend to engage students primarily and foster engagement in one&rsquo;s community regardless of the individual causes that they work with specifically. This blog is primarily meant to inform and notify volunteers about activities and events we are running, however, we will also be posting information about protests that you can participate in. As we are just starting, we need your help! So help us out by spreading awareness of this organization and getting others involved in our events. Once again, thanks for volunteering!</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>The SAFA Leadership</p>
