<p>Hey SAFA volunteers! We are holding a meeting this Friday (tomorrow) to discuss the bake sale, brainstorm ways we can help causes, talk about the future of SAFA, and more. We invite you to join us. We might also have someone from Planned Parenthood come in and detail ways we can help that organization. One of the ways we are helping them right now is with our bake sale. We have great volunteers helping us already but we still need more. We will post a second message later detailing how you can help with the bake sale. At the meeting, we will also be handing out signs for the upcoming <a href="https://studentactivistsforamerica.github.io/2017/01/nobannowall-sf-protest/">NoBanNoWall protest</a> this saturday. Thanks and we hope to see you tomorrow at our meeting!</p>
